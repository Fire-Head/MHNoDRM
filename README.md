# MHNoDRM
MHNoDRM is a plugin that removes persistently active anti-piracy measures in Steam release of Manhunt accidentally left by Rockstar Games since 22 May 2010 update.
It's made by emulating correct SecuROM triggers behavior and provides an alternative way to fix the game without replacing/modifying original executable.

All booby traps list:

* Locked Doors
* Broken Painkillers
* Broken Level Initialization
* Broken Input
* Broken Save Points
* Broken Interactivities
* Broken Stealth Mechanic
* More Damage Taken
* Disappearing Ammo
* Dragging Item Memory Leak
* Dropped Item Disappearance
* Help Box Memory Leak
* Save Point Corruption


**Please note that this plugin does not affect Steam copy protection in any way, and won't let you run Manhunt without Steam client installed with a legally purchased copy of the game on your account.**

**Also, it won't fix real compatibility issues like a broken fps limiter or looped audio bug in some scenes, you still need [other fixes](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Manhunt).**
